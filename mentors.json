I really enjoy working with people to design better and more useful products. At UNC-Chapel Hill, I completed an Information Science and Psychology double major. I started out as a Computer Science major, but decided that I wanted to focus on people instead of computers. Since then, I’ve done work in user-centered design, web development, and graphic design. Later on, I will attend a graduate program in Human-Computer Interaction. I consider myself a “maker,” so I like to cook, sketch, paint, build model kits, and work on DIY projects.
